Conditionals in Processing (Java)
=================================

Logic? Logic!

—

booleans -> true or false

In code: boolean

int x = 10;
boolean imCool = false;

—

if statement:

* (conditional)
* {code block} -> executed if conditional is true

else:

* follows and if, never by itself
* executed if the condition in the if above was false

else if:

* chain conditions one after the other


// shoe choices in my program
if(it’s raining outside) {
	wearBoots();
}
else {
	// not raining
	if(it’s above 65 degrees) {
		wearSandals();
	}
	else {
		wearSneakers();
	}
}

# In ~English:

if A is true -> then do XYZ

if A is false -> then do 123 instead

# In (pseudo)code:

if(A == true) {
	do XYZ
}

if(A == false) {
	do 123
}


—

# In ~English:

if B is true -> then do the dishes

else if C is true -> play Halo (infinity or whatever damn version)

else -> do meh homework


# In (pseudo)code:

if(B == true) {
	doTheDishes();
}
else if(C == true) {
	playHalo();
}
else {
	doMehHomework();
}

# In ~English:

if A and B are true -> then do something

V

if A is true -> then if B is true -> then do something

# In (pseudo)code:

if(A is true AND B is true) {
	doSomething();
}

AND -> both things are true

—


# In ~English:

if A or B are true -> then do something

# In (pseudo)code:

if(A is true OR B is true) {
	doSomething();
}

OR -> either of the things are true


—

# In ~English:

I’m cool = true

if I’m cool -> I get the guy/girl for a night out

if I’m not cool -> I eat ice cream and watch Netflix (tomorrow is a better day)

# In (pseudo)code:

// declare boolean variable
boolean imCool = true;

if(imCool == true) {
	nightOut();
}

// imCool == false
if(imCool != true) {
	iceCreamNetflix();
}

|
V

// short for imCool == true
if(imCool) {
	nightOut;
}

// ! -> not or negation, inverts the boolean value
// short for imCool == false or imCool != true
// reads like “if I’m NOT cool”
if(!imCool) {
	iceCreamNetflix();
}
